		<h1>02 Prepare: Evaulate Performance of Alternative Solutions / Big-O Notation</h1>
				
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This week you will explore skill of Evaluating Performance of Alternative Solutions.  To support this evaluation, you will learn how to use Big-O notation.  You are still in the <strong>PREPARE</strong> phase of the course:</p>

		<p>Here is the two day plan for this lesson:</p>
		<ul><p><u>Day 1</u> - Complete the reading below.  The reading should take 1 hour to complete.  For on-campus students, class time will be used to discuss the reading and explore Stacks through examples.  You should begin independently to work on <a href="02-prove.html" target="_blank">02-Prove</a>.  You should plan on the assignment taking 3 hours to complete.</p></ul>
		<ul><p><u>Day 2</u> - You will work with your study group to complete <a href="02-teach.html" target="_blank">02-Teach</a>.  On-campus students will complete this activity during class time.  The activity should take 1 hour to complete.  You should independently finish work on <a href="02-prove.html" target="_blank">02-Prove</a>.</p></ul>
		
			<h2>Big-O Notation</h2>
		<p>To evaluate code and look for alternative solutions, it is important that we have a common method for quanitfying the performance of code in terms of time.  The principles we will learn can also be applied to analysis of how much memory or space is used by code to perform a task.</p>
		
		<h3>Simple Example - Linear Performance</h3>
		
		<p>TBD</p>
		
		<h3>Polynomial Performance</h3>
		
		<p>TBD</p>

		<h3>Logarithmic Performance</h3>
		
		<p>TBD</p>
		
		<h3>Performance of the Dynamic Arrays</h3>
		
		<p>TBD</p>
