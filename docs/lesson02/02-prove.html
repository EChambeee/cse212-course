        <h1>02 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 2).  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are 3 parts to this assignment.</p>
		<h3>Part 1 - Analyze Code</h3>
	  <p>In this section, you will be asked several multiple choice and matching questions related to performance using Big-O notation.  You will mark your answers in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code and determine the Big-O notation for the <code>sort_list</code> function: <a href="sorting.py" target="_blank">sorting.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Open up the following code and determine the Big-O notation for the 3 implementations of calculating the standard deviation from a list of numbers: <a href="standard_deviation.py" target="_blank">standard_deviation.py</a> </p></li>
 		    <li><p>There are several other common Big-O notations that occur in various algorithms including:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Merge Sort Algorithm - O(n * log n) - Logarithmic Linear Time</li>
				<li>Travelling Salesman Algorithm - O(2 ^ n) - Exponential Time</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using either a graphing calculator or a graphing website (e.g. <a href="http://desmos.com/calulator" target="_blank">desmos.com</a>), put the following in order (best performance first and worst performance last) for when <code>n</code> is big:</p>
				<p>O(n^2), O(1), O(2^n), O(n * log n), O(log n), O(n)</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 2 - Predicting, Measuring, and Comparing - 2 Sorting Algorithms</h3>
		<ol>
		<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="search.py" target="_blank">search.py</a> </p></li>
		<li><p>This file contains 2 different functions called <code>search_sorted_1</code> and <code>search_sorted_2</code>.  Both of these function will search for an item in a sorted list.  Predict the performance of each function using Big-O notation.</p></li>
			<li><p>Run the code and observe the outputs.  Here is what the columns in the table represent:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><code>n</code> - The size of the data given to the functions in this test</p></li>
			<li><p><code>sort1_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>search_sorted_1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>sort2_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>search_sorted_2</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>sort1_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>search_sorted_1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>sort2_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>search_sorted_2</code></p></li>
				
			</ul>
			<p>While the <code>sort#_count</code> value should be the same in every execution, the <code>sort#_time</code> will vary every time it is executed on the same or different computers. For the timing numbers, the code ran the test 100 times and took the average.  This was done since there are some operating system conditions that could affect timing in some cases.  To ensure worst case, each test tried to find a number that was not in the list.</p></li>
		<li><p>Answer the following questions:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>What is the performance using Big-O notation for each function (based on both your predictions and the actual results)?</p></li>
			<li><p>Which function has the better performance in the worst case?</p></li>
			<li><p>For both functions, explain in detail how you determined the Big-O notation by just looking at the code without the benefit of observing actual execution results.</p></li>		
			<li><p>It is possible in the best case for each of these functions to complete in O(1) time.  What scenario would give this result for both functions?</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>You will provide your responses in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>The last question in the I-Learn quiz will ask you to write a paragraph about the negative implications of forgetting to do performance analysis as a software engineer in the field.  You should use your experiences from the Group Practice and this Assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
