      <h1>02 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>You should complete these practice problems with one or more members from your assigned study group.  You will be analyzing code to determine the expected performance using Big-O notation as well measuing the actual execution time.  This practice is simlair to the individual work you will complete in <a href="02-prove.html" target="_blank">02-Prove</a>. This practice should take no more than 1 hour.  If you are about to run out of time, you may look at the solutions and discuss them.</p>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  <h3>Problem 1 - Analyze Code</h3>
		  <p>In this section, you will be asked several questions related to performance using Big-O notation.  When you are done, compare your answers with the solution posted here: <a href="performance-solution.html" target="_blank">performance-solution.html</a>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>TBD</p></li>
			<li><p>TBD</p></li>
			<li><p>TBD</p></li>
			<li><p>TBD</p></li>
		  	<li><p>There are several other common Big-O notations that occur in various algorithms including:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Merge Sort Algorithm - O(n * log n) - Logarithmic Linear Time</li>
				<li>Travelling Salesman Algorithm - O(2 ^ n) - Exponential Time</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using either a graphing calculator or a graphing website (e.g. <a href="desmos.com/calulator" target="_blank">desmos.com</a>), put the following in order (best performance first and worst performance last):</p>
				<p>O(n^2), O(1), O(2^n), O(n * log n), O(log n), O(n)</p></li>
		</ol>

	  <h3>Problem 2 - Predict, Measure, and Compare Code</h3>	
		<ol>
		<li><p>Download the following code and load into your code editor: <a href="algorithms.py" target="_blank">algorithms.py</a> (NOTE: Do not run the code until your asked to below)</p></li>
		<li><p>This file contains 3 different functions called <code>algorithm1</code>, <code>algorithm2</code>, and <code>algorithm3</code>.  Predict the performance of each function using Big-O notation.</p></li>
			<li><p>Run the code and observe the outputs.  Here is what the columns in the table represent:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><code>n</code> - The size of the data given to the functions in this test</p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg1_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg2_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm2</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg3_count</code> - The number of loop iterations (i.e. work) done by <code>algorithm3</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg1_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm1</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg2_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm2</code></p></li>
			<li><p><code>alg3_time</code> - The time in milliseconds it took to complete <code>algorithm3</code></p></li>
				
			</ul>
			<p>While the <code>alg#_count</code> value should be the same in every execution, the <code>alg#_time</code> will vary every time it is executed on the same or different computers. For the timing numbers, the code ran the test 10 times and took the average.  This was done since there are some operating system conditions that could affect timing in some cases.</p></li>
		<li><p>Discuss the following together:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Do the actual results agree with the Big-O predictions made earlier?  If not, what do you think the Big-O should be?</p></li>
			<li><p>Which function (<code>algorithm1</code>, <code>algorithm2</code>, <code>algorithm3</code>) has the best performance and which one the worst performance?</p></li>		
			<li><p>Looking at the results, why do we say that Big-O only applies when <code>n</code> is &quot;large&quot;</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the solution and discuss it together: <a href="algorithms-solution.html" target="_blank">algorithms-solution.html</a></p></li>
		</ol>
		
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>When finished, please complete the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
