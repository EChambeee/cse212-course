      <h1>06 Teach: Group Collaboration</h1>
		
      <h2>Overview</h2>
	  <p>With your assigned study group, you should spend up to one hour collaborating together on the <a href="06-prove.html" target="_blank">06-Prove</a> problems.  <strong>You must not share your actual code solutions with each other</strong>.  During this time together, you should share strategy, technique, and examples to help each other learn the material.  Make sure that each person in your group has an opportunity to share ideas and ask questions.  You should prepare yourself for this activity by starting or completing several of the problems from the individual prove assignment.</p>
		
		<p>As you solve the problems, remember to use the principles learned in the first five lessons of the course:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Problem Solving Strategy: understand the problem, plan and design the solution, implement the solution, and evaluate the solution.</p></li>
		<li><p>Evaluate Performance of Alternative Solutions: use big O to determine the best solution.</p></li>
		<li><p>Understanding Code Using Reviews: analyze any code you have been given.</p></li>
		<li><p>Finding Defects Using Tests: write tests to determine if your solution is working.</p></li>
		<li><p>Answering Technical Interview Questions: imagine that you were asked one of these questions during an interview.  Remember to ensure that you fully understand the problem and work through different scenarios manually.  Consider how the data structure you are using will help you solve the problem.  A notebook or a whiteboard can be very useful in this process.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When finished, please complete the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
