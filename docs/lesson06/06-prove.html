        <h1>06 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 6).  With the exception of the group collaboration activity that you did in W06-Teach, you should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will provide your code and solution strategies in the associated I-Learn quiz. Your grade will be based on how many problems you answer correctly.  Bonus points are available for answering all five problems correctly.</p>

        <h2>Problem Set</h2>
		
		<p>Download the following code file and use it to solve all five problems:  <a href="maps.py" target="_blank">maps.py</a></p>

		<h3>Problem 1 - Translator Class</h3>
		<p>Implement the <code>add_word</code> and <code>translate</code> functions in the Translator class using a Python dictionary.  The <code>add_word</code> function should allow the user to add word translations (e.g. english to german).  The <code>translate</code> function should return the translation of a word.  If the translation is not available for a word, then "???" should be returned instead.</p>
		
		<h3>Problem 2 - Degree Summary</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>summarize_degrees</code> function which reads a file and creates a Python dictionary containing a summary of all the degrees (education) that people earned as reported in the file.  You should use the following file for testing: <a href="census.csv" target="_blank">census.csv</a>.</p>
			
		<h3>Problem 3 - Anagrams</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>is_anagram</code> function to determine if two words are anagrams.  Two words are an anagram if they use the same letters and the same number of letters.  For example, "CAT" and "ACT" are anagrams but "DOG" and "GOOD" are not because "GOOD" has two O's.  You must use a Python dictionary to solve this problem.</p>
				
		<h3>Problem 4 - Maze</h3>
		<p>Implement the <code>move_left</code>, <code>move_right</code>, <code>move_up</code>, and <code>move_down</code> functions in the Maze class.  The code provides a sample Maze in the form of a dictionary where the key represents the (x,y) coordinate in the maze and the value contains the valid movements in the format (left, right, up, down).  The valid movements are set to True and False.  The dictionary maze shown in the code can be represented graphically as follows (note that it is assumed there is a wall going around the entire maze which means that you cannot leave the outside boundaries of the maze):</p>
		<img src="maze.jpeg" alt="A maze that has 6 rows (y=1 to y=6) and 6 columns (x=1 to x=6).  Walls are drawn in the following blocks: (3,1) (3,2) (4,2) (6,2) (1,3) (3,3) (6,4) (2,5) (4,5) (6,5) (2,6) (4,6).">
		
		<h3>Problem 5 - Earthquake JSON Data</h3>
		<p>Finish implementing the <code>earthquake_daily_summary</code> function to display all the earthquake locations ('place' attribute) and magnitudes ('mag' attribute) for the current day from the United States Geological Service (USGS) website.  The <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson_detail.php" target="_blank">USGS Website</a> provides details about how to interpret the data that you will receive from their server.  The data uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  In Python, JSON data is represented as a dictionary. The code uses the 'requests' library to read data from the server.  To use this library, you will need to install the 'requests' package.  To install the package, run <code>pip install requests</code> within a terminal.</p>
