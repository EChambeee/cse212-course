        <h1>06 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong>.  With the exception of the Group Collaboration activity that you did in <a href="06-prove.html" target="_blank">06-Teach</a>, you should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will provide your code and solution strategies in the associated I-Learn quiz. Your grade will be based on how many problems you answer correctly.</p>

        <h2>Problem Set</h2>
		
		<p>Download the following code file and use it to solve all 5 problems:  <a href="maps.py" target="_blank">maps.py</a></p>

		<h3>Problem 1</h3>
		<p>TBD</p>
		
		<h3>Problem 2</h3>

		<h3>Problem 3</h3>

		<h3>Problem 4</h3>
