        <h1>10 Prove: Final Project - Outline</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Before you spend time implementing the tutorial, you should first build an outline.  Just like preparing to write a report, an outline can help you organize your thoughts and split up the work into manageble pieces.  The <a href="outline.html" target="_blank">outline for the Python Fundamentals Tutorial</a> that you were given as an example in the reading this week should be used as a template.  Please remember that your tutorial should involve data structures as described in the project requirements.  Your outline should clearly identify the three data structures you will be teaching in your tutorial.  You should submit your outline in the associated I-Learn quiz.
