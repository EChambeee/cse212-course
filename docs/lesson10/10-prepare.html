		<h1>10 Prepare: Introduction to Final Project</h1>
				
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Starting this week, the course transitions to the <strong>PROVE</strong> phase of the course.  During this phase, you will not be learning any new material or working with your assigned study group.  For the remainder of the semester you will individually prove your abilities related to data structures by completing a final project (ref: Syllabus Course Outcomes 1 through 6).  The details of the final project are described below in the reading.</p>
			
		<img src="../images/cse212_phase3.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Shows the 3 phases of the course as described in the Syllabus.  Phase 3 is highlighted."/>
		
		<p>Here is the two-day plan for this lesson:</p>
		<ul><p><u>Day 1</u> - Complete the reading below.  The reading should take one hour to complete.  Begin work on your final project.  </p></ul>
		<ul><p><u>Day 2</u> - Continue work on your final project. For on-campus students, class time will be used to work on your project independently and ask questions as needed.  Online students should use Slack to ask questions with your Instructor.  You should submit <a href="10-prove.html" target="_blank">10-Prove</a> to provide status on your final project progress.</p></ul>
		
		<h2>Final Project Description</h2>
		
		<p>The information below is the complete description for the final project.  You should refer back to this page during the remainder of the semester.  You may want to print this page out for easier reference.  The sections below include the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Project Description</p></li>
		<li><p>Complete Example</p></li>
		<li><p>Using Markdown Language</p></li>
		<li><p>Schedule</p></li>
		<li><p>Grading Rubric</p></li>			
		<li><p>Working Independently</p></li>						
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Project Description</h3>
		
		<p>To prove that you understand the material from this course, you will be required to create a <strong>Data Structure Tutorial</strong>.  The tutorial must be meet the following requirements:</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li><p>The tutorial must cover three different data structures as follows:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Select one of the following: stack, queue</p></li>
				<li><p>Select one of the following: set, linked list</p></li>
				<li><p>You must include the following: tree</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p>You must write the tutorial using Markdown language.</p></li>
		<li><p>Each of the three data structure training modules must include:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Detailed and organized coverage of the topic with documentation including (but not limited to) example python code, diagrams, and tables.  You should assume that the student using your tutorial will already know how to program in Python.  <u>This should be written in your own words.  Remember, you are the teacher now.</u></p></li>
				<li><p>A complete example of a problem solved using the data structure.  The problem should be <u>created by you</u> and not be a copy of an existing problem.</p></li>
				<li><p>A second problem (again created by you) which is given to the student of your tutorial to solve on their own.  You need to provide a link to the solution.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Complete Example</h3>
		
		<p>To help you visualize what this project requires, a complete <a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse212-course/tree/master/python_fundamentals/0-welcome.md" target="_blank">Python Fundamentals Tutorial</a> example has been provided.  This example covers three fundamental topics in Python programming: decisions, loops, and functions.  Please note that your tutorial will <strong>not</strong> be on these basic Python topics.  Your tutorial will be on data structures as described in project requirements shown in the previous section.  </p>
		<p>You should pattern your data structure tutorial by having the following file structure:</p>
		
		<table style="table-layout: fixed">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 25%">Filename</th>
      <th style="width: 75%">Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0-welcome.md</td>
      <td>Provide an introduction to the student as well as links to three modules.  It is important that you provide your name, class, section, and email address on this page. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the first data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the second data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the third data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Picture Files</td>
      <td>If you want a picture (eg., jpg, bmp, gif, png) to be included in your tutorial, then you need to make sure the files are included in your tutorial submittal.  If you copy an image from the internet, make sure that you can legally copy it and be sure to provide source information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Python Files</td>
      <td>You will likely want to include python files for the student to see the solution.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Files</td>
      <td>If you have any other file that needs to be displayed or accessed by your tutorial, make sure they are included in your submittal.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

		<h3>Using Markdown Language</h3>
		
		<p>The Markdown language is a commonly used to develop documentation.  Using a simple editor and the knoweldge of a little bit of syntax, you can create documents with headers, bulleted lists, links, bold text, tables and pictures.  A common place to see markdown documents is in GitHub repositories.  The link above for the example tutorial was shown to you in GitHub.  GitHub automatically interpreted the markdown file and displayed as intended.</p>
		
		<p>There are many different tools available to help you write and preview markdown files.  Visual Studio Code has built-in support for markdown.  If you create a file with an <code>md</code> extension, then you can click on the preview button you can see the markdown and the finished product side by side.</p>
		
		<img src="visual_studio_code.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows the 0-welcome.md file from the example loaded into Visual Studio Code with the preview enabled.">
		
		<p>Another example of a tool is called <a href="http://typora.io/">Typora</a>.  Tools like this (and others which you can easily search the internet for) provide you with a traditional editor that will create markdown code for you.</p>
		
		<img src="typora.jpg" height="100%" width="100%" alt="Shows the 0-welcome.md file from the example loaded into Typora.">
		
		<p>Writing is markdown requires the memorization of some basic syntax (here an example of a <a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf">cheat sheet</a> you might find useful).  Listed below is syntax that was used in the example tutorial.</p>
		
		<pre><code class="Markdown">	
# Title

When you put a hash sign in front, you get a header.

If you want sub-headings, use more than one hash:

# Header
## Section
### Sub-Section

To make a bulleted list, use a single star in front:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

To make an ordered list, use numbers:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

To highlight some code in your sentence use the 
back-tick (left leaning apostrophe) around the code 
like this `x = 42`

If you have a block of code you want to show, use three back-ticks
before and after the code.  If you put the name of the programming 
language after the firth back-ticks, then it will highlight the 
syntax for you:

```python
x = 3
y = 7
z = x * y
print(z)
```

To put text in italics, use a single star:  *i am italics*
To put text in bold, use two stars: **i am bold**

To create a link use the format: 
[Text to Display](filename or link)

To display a picture use the format: 
![Alternate Text to Display](filename or link)

To display a table, use hyphens and pipes (vertial bars):

header 1 | header 2 | header 3
-------- | -------- | --------
value 11 | value 21 | value 31
value 12 | value 22 | value 32
value 13 | value 23 | value 33
		</code></pre>
		
		<h3>Schedule</h3>
		
		<p>You have four weeks to complete this project.  No new material will be discussed during these final phase of the course.  For on-campus students, all class time (except for the first An overview of the entire schedule is given below:</p>

	  <th style="width: 45%">Submit</th>			
    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td>10</td>
	  <td>Learn the markdown language and write an outline for the tutorial.  Start work on the welcome page.</td>
	  <td>Submit (W10-Prove) your outline.  An example outline is shown in W10-Prove.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
	  <td>13</td>
	  <td>Implement your third data structure module.</td>
	  <td>Submit (W13-Prove) your final project.  You will need to submit all files individually into I-Learn.  This is due on the last day of the semester as shown in I-Learn.  There is no final exam.</td>
    </tr>
	</table>
		
		<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
		
		<p>Grading of the final project will be done as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>A - Demonstrate creativity while providing an engaging tutorial.</p></li>
		<li><p>B - Complete all the requirements of the project.</p></li>
		<li><p>C - Missing some components of the project or contains numerous technical errors.</p></li>
		<li><p>D/F - Mising many components of the projects or contains significant technical errors.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Working Independently</h3>
		
		<p>This final project <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcomes 1 through 6).  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you design or write your project.  It is an honor code violation to obtain text or example problems for your project from others including using the internet (i.e. sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
