		<h1>10 Prepare: Introduction to Final Project</h1>
				
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Starting this week, the course transitions to the <strong>PROVE</strong> phase of the course.  During this phase, you will not be learning any new material or working with your assigned study group.  For the remainder of the semester you will individually prove your abilities related to data structures by completing a final project (ref: Syllabus Course Outcomes 1 through 6).  The details of the final project are described below in the reading.</p>
			
		<img src="../images/cse212_phase3.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Shows the 3 phases of the course as described in the Syllabus.  Phase 3 is highlighted."/>
		
		<p>Here is the two-day plan for this lesson:</p>
		<ul><p><u>Day 1</u> - Complete the reading below.  The reading should take one hour to complete.  Begin work on your final project.  </p></ul>
		<ul><p><u>Day 2</u> - Continue work on your final project. For on-campus students, class time will be used to work on your project independently and ask questions as needed.  Online students should use Slack to ask questions with your Instructor.  You should submit <a href="10-prove.html" target="_blank">10-Prove</a> to provide status on your final project progress.</p></ul>
		
		<h2>Final Project Description</h2>
		
		<p>The information below is the complete description for the final project.  You should refer back to this page during the remainder of the semester.  You may want to print this page out for easier reference.  The sections below include the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Project Description</p></li>
		<li><p>Complete Example</p></li>
		<li><p>Using Markdown Language</p></li>
		<li><p>Schedule</p></li>
		<li><p>Grading Rubric</p></li>			
		<li><p>Working Independently</p></li>						
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Project Description</h3>
		
		<p>To prove that you understand the material from this course, you will be required to create a <strong>Data Structure Tutorial</strong>.  The tutorial must be meet the following requirements:</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li><p>The tutorial must cover three different data structures as follows:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Select one of the following: stack, queue</p></li>
				<li><p>Select one of the following: set, linked list</p></li>
				<li><p>You must include the following: tree</p></li>
			</ul>
		<li><p>You must write the tutorial using Markdown language.</p></li>
		<li><p>Each of the three data structure training modules must include:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Detailed and organized coverage of the topic with documentation including (but not limited to) example python code, diagrams, and tables.  You should assume that the student using your tutorial will already know how to program in Python.  <u>This should be written in your own words.  Remember, you are the teacher now.</u></p></li>
				<li><p>A complete example of a problem solved using the data structure.  The problem should be <u>created by you</u> and not be a copy of an existing problem.</p></li>
				<li><p>A second problem (again created by you) which is given to the student of your tutorial to solve on their own.  You need to provide a link to the solution.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Complete Example</h3>
		
		<p>To help you visualize what this project requires, a complete <a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse212-course/tree/master/python_fundamentals/0-welcome.md">Python Fundamentals Tutorial</a> example has been provided.  This example covers three fundamental topics in Python programming: decisions, loops, and functions.  You should pattern your data structure tutorial by having the following file structure:</p>
		
		<table style="table-layout: fixed">
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 25%">Filename</th>
      <th style="width: 75%">Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0-welcome.md</td>
      <td>Provide an introduction to the student as well as links to three modules.  It is important that you provide your name, class, section, and email address on this page. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the first data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the second data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3-topic.md</td>
      <td>Provide the tutorial for the third data structure topic.  You should include a link back to the welcome page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Picture Files</td>
      <td>If you want a picture (eg., jpg, bmp, gif, png) to be included in your tutorial, then you need to make sure the files are included in your tutorial submittal.  If you copy an image from the internet, make sure that you can legally copy it and be sure to provide source information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Python Files</td>
      <td>You will likely want to include python files for the student to see the solution.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Files</td>
      <td>If you have any other file that needs to be displayed or accessed by your tutorial, make sure they are included in your submittal.</td>
    </tr>
