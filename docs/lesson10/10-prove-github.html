        <h1>W10 Prove: Final Project - Outline</h1>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Before you spend time implementing the final project, you should first build an outline.  Just like preparing to write a report, an outline can help you organize your thoughts and split up the work into manageable pieces.  You can use the <a href="https://github.com/byui-cse/cse212-course/blob/master/python_fundamentals/outline.md" target="_blank">outline for the Python Fundamentals Tutorial example</a> as a template for your outline.  Please remember that your tutorial should involve data structures as described in the project requirements.  Your outline should clearly identify the three data structures you will be teaching in your tutorial.  Your outline should also include some planned sub-topics.  These sub-topics might change when you start to write the tutorial. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a github repository for the tutorial</li>
            <li>Add your instructor as a collaborator to your github repository</li>
            <li>Add your <code>outline.md</code> file to the repository</li>
        </ol>
			
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the link to your github repository to your <code>outline.md</code> file</p>
