      <h1>03 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>You should complete these practice problems with one or more members from your assigned study group.  You will be using review to understand the behavior of code that uses a Stack to solve a problem (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 3).  This practice is similar to the individual work you will complete in 03-Prove. This practice should take no more than one hour.  If you are about to run out of time, you may look at the solutions and discuss them.</p>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  <h3>Problem 1 - Simple Stack</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="simple_stack.pdf" target="_blank">simple_stack.pdf</a>  (Note: You should not execute this code.  After you complete these practice problems, you are welcome to execute the code).
			</p>
		  </li>
		<li>
			<p>This code has a varied mix of push (i.e. Python append function) and pop operations performed on a stack.  Manually walk through the code and predict what the final print statement will display.  Even if you are good at keeping track of information in your mind, you should use a sheet of paper to keep track of the stack after each step.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		  	<p>When you are done, take a look at following the solution and discuss it together:  <a href="simple_stack-solution.pdf" target="_blank">simple_stack-solution.pdf</a>
			</p>
		  </li>
			</ol>
	  <h3>Problem 2 - Complicated Stack</h3>	
  	  <ol>
		  <li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="complicated_stack.pdf" target="_blank">complicated_stack.pdf</a>  (Note: You should not execute this code.  After you complete these practice problems, you are welcome to execute the code).
			</p>
		  </li>
		<li>
			<p>The code does "something."  Read through the code and form a hypothesis of what it does.  You should write down your thoughts before you proceed to the next step.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  <p>Test your hypothesis by "running" the following three tests.  You should not run the Python code on your computer.  You should use paper and pencil to desk check the code using the inputs provided below.  What will the function return if you input <code>line</code> is equal to:</p>
			  <ul>
			  <li>(a == 3 or (b == 5 and c == 6))</li>
			  <li>(students[i].grade &gt; 80 and students[i.grade &lt; 90)</li>
			  <li>(robot[id + 1].execute(.pass() or (not robot[id * (2 + i)].alive and stormy) or (robot[id - 1].alive and lava_flowing))</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		  	<p>When you are done, take a look at the following solution and discuss it together:  <a href="complicated_stack-solution.pdf" target="_blank">complicated_stack-solution.pdf</a>
			</p>
		  </li>
	  
	  </ol>
	  
		
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>When finished, please complete the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
