        <h1>03 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong>.  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are 3 parts to this assignment.</p>
		<h3>Part 1 - First Mystery Stack</h3>
        <ol>
						<li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="mystery_stack_1.pdf" target="_blank">mystery_stack_1.pdf</a></p>
		  </li>
			<li><p>Using techniques learned in the reading and practice this week, determine what this code does.</p></li>
			<li><p>What is the output of the function if the input <code>text</code> is equal to the following:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>racecar</p></li>
				<li><p>stressed</p></li>
				<li><p>a nut for a jar of tuna</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>You will summarize your findings in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>

		</ol>
		<h3>Part 2 - Second Mystery Stack</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="mystery_stack_2.pdf" target="_blank">mystery_stack_2.pdf</a></p>
		  </li>
			<li><p>Using techniques learned in the reading and practice this week, determine what this code does.</p></li>
			<li><p>Propose a value for the input parameter <code>text</code> that will result in the function doing the following:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>Returning an answer of positive 5</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 1!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 2!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 3!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 4!"</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>You will summarize your findings in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>The last question in the I-Learn quiz will ask you to write a paragraph comparing the reading of code to the reading of a book.  You should also consider how you can improve your reading of code in the next year.  You should use your experiences from the Group Practice and this Assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
