        <h1>03 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  You should not complete this project within a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you design or write your project.  It is an honor code violation to obtain text or example problems for your project from others including using the internet (i.e. sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		
		<p>Download the 03-prove_response.docx document to provide your answers to questions asked in the steps below.</p>
		
		<h3>Part 1 - First Mystery Stack</h3>
        <ol>
			<li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="mystery_stack_1.pdf" target="_blank">mystery_stack_1.pdf</a></p>
		  </li>
			<li><p>Using techniques learned in the reading and practice this week, determine what this code does and how the use of a stack helps in the implementation.  Record the answer in your response document.</p></li>
			<li><p>In your response document, write down the output of the function if the input <code>text</code> is equal to the following:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>racecar</p></li>
				<li><p>stressed</p></li>
				<li><p>a nut for a jar of tuna</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		</ol>
		<h3>Part 2 - Second Mystery Stack</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Open the following PDF copy of code: <a href="mystery_stack_2.pdf" target="_blank">mystery_stack_2.pdf</a></p>
		  </li>
			<li><p>Using techniques learned in the reading and practice this week, determine what this code does and how the use of a stack helps in the implementation.  Record the answer in your response document.</p></li>
			<li><p>Propose a value in your response document for the input parameter <code>text</code> that will result in the function doing the following:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>Returning an answer of positive 5</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 1!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 2!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 3!"</p></li>
				<li><p>The display of "Invalid Case 4!"</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>In your response document, write a paragraph comparing the reading of code to the reading of a book.  You should also consider how you can improve your reading of code in the next year.  You should use your experiences from the group practice and this assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
		
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the following files for this assignment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><code>03-prove_response.docx</code> - All answers should be provided.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please submit each file seperately.  Do not use a compression tool (e.g., zip, rar) to combine the files.</p>
