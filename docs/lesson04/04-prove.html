        <h1>04 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 4).  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including using the internet (i.e. sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are three parts to this assignment.</p>
		<h3>Part 1 - Taking Turns Queue</h3>
        <ol>
			<li><p>Download the following code file: <a href="taking_turns_queue.py" target="_blank">taking_turns_queue.py</a>  (Note: Do not read through the code first.  Instead, proceed with the instructions below).</p></li>
			<li><p>The Taking_Turns_Queue class maintains a circular queue of people.  When a person is added, they are assigned a number of turns (which could be infinite).  When a person is removed from the queue, they are re-added to the queue if they still have turns left.  Here are the detailed requirements:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Each record in the Taking Turns Queue shall contain the name of the person and the number of turns they will get (a value of 0 or less means an infinite number of turns). </li>
			<li>The add_person function shall enqueue a person into the queue.</li>
			<li>The get_next_person function shall dequeue a person from the queue and display their name.</li>
			<li>When a person is dequeued and still has turns left, they shall be enqueued again.</li>
			<li>When a person is dequeued and has an infinite number of turns, they shall be enqueued again.</li>
			<li>If the queue is empty, then an error message shall be displayed.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>Test cases are already written for you in the code.  Run the tests, find the errors, and fix the code.  You will summarize your findings in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 2 - Priority Queue</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Download the following code file: <a href="priority_queue.py" target="_blank">priority_queue.py</a> (Note: Do not read through the code first.  Instead, proceed with the instructions below).</p></li>
			<li><p>The Priority_Queue class maintains a queue where each value put in the queue also has a priority (higher numbers have a higher priority).  When you add to the queue, it goes to the back as expected.  When you remove from the queue, the highest priority item is removed.  If there are multiple values with the same high priority, then the first one (following the FIFO strategy) is removed first.  Here are the detailed requirements:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Each node in the Priority Queue shall contain a value and a priority (higher numbers have a higher priority). </li>
			<li>The enqueue function shall add a node to the back of the queue.</li>
			<li>The dequeue function shall remove the node with the highest priority and return its value.</li>
			<li>If there are more than one node with the highest priority, then the item closest to the front of the queue will be removed and its value returned.</li>
			<li>If the queue is empty, then an error message will be displayed.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><p>You need to write your own test cases based on these requirements.</p></li>
			<li><p>Run your test cases, find the errors, and fix the code.  You will summarize your findings in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>The last question in the I-Learn quiz will ask you to write a paragraph summarizing the common errors that can occur when working with a queue.  You should use your experiences from the group practice and this assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
