        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Congratulations!  You have completed CSE212.  In this course you learned many important software engineering skills that will be useful to you in your career. These skills have included the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Problem Solver: Apply a systematic approach to writing code to solve problems.</p></li>
		<li><p>Evaluator: Evaluate the performance of alternative solutions using big O notation.</p></li>
		<li><p>Reviewer: Predict the purpose and behavior of existing code.</p></li>
		<li><p>Tester: Discover defects using testing in code.</p></li>
		<li><p>Conversant: Articulate the answers to technical questions involving data structures.</p></li>
		<li><p>Self-Reliant: Solve problems independently.</p></li>			
		</ul>
		
		<p>In addition to learning these software engineering skills, you have also learned about numerous data structures.  You have explored the purpose, performance, and application of each of the data structures.  These data structures have included the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Dynamic Arrays</p></li>
		<li><p>Stacks</p></li>			
		<li><p>Queues</p></li>
		<li><p>Sets</p></li>
		<li><p>Maps</p></li>			
		<li><p>Linked Lists</p></li>
		<li><p>Trees</p></li>			
		</ul>
		
		<p>All of these topics are likely to be tested in your future job and internship interviews.  Regular review and use of these skills and data structures should be part of your future plans.</p>
		
		<p>The final project is due on the last day of the semester.  You should submit your final project in <a href="14-prove.html" target="_blank">14-Prove</a>.  There is no final exam.</p></ul>
