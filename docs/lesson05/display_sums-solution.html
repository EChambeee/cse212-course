		<p><strong>Question</strong>: How can find pairs of numbers in a list (assume no duplicates) that sum to a value of 10 and display them in O(n) time using a Set data structure?</p>
		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If we looked at one number in the list (call it n), then we need to determine if the number 10-n is in the list.  Instead of searching through the list each time to look for 10-n, it would be convienant if there was a set containing numbers so we can lookup in O(1) time for the number 10-n.  We could put all the items in the list into a set first.  If we have the set initially, then we can loop through all the numbers in the list and look in the set for 10-n.  Another option is to build the set while we are looping through the numbers.  This might not seem to work because the set doesn't have all the numbers in yet to check.  However, remember we are looking for pairs.  If my list was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], if I was on 2 in the loop, then 10-2 (or 8) is not yet in the Set.  However, eventually we will get to the 8 and then 2 will be in Set by that time.  Building the set as you loop through the list looking for pairs does work.</p>
