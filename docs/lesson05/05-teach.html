      <h1>05 Teach: Group Practice</h1>
		
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>You should complete these practice problems with one or more members from your assigned study group.  You will be solving problems using sets by first discussing how the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of the set can help you arrive at the answer (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 5).  When asked to solve a problem in an interview, the interviewer will be very interested in your knowledge of data structures even if you can't fully solve the entire problem verbally. This practice is similar to the individual work you will complete in 05-Prove.  This practice should take no more than one hour.  If you are about to run out of time, you may look at the solutions and discuss them.</p>
		
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
	  <h3>Problem 1 - Unique Letters</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
		  <p> Download the following code and load it into your code editor: <a href="unique_letters.py" target="_blank">unique_letters.py</a></p></li>
		<li><p>This code will determine if a string has all unique letters. For example, "abcdefg" has unique letters but "abccdefg" does not because the "c" is repeated more than once.  The code is implemented using loops which results in an O(n^2) performance.</p></li>
		<li><p>Answer this question together:  how can the unique letter function be written with better performance using a set data structure?  As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of a set to help you arrive at the answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you think you know how to solve the problem (take no more than five minutes), <a href="unique_letters-solution.html" target="_blank">read the answer to the question</a> and compare with your initial answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>Based on your understanding, modify the unique_letters function so it uses a set instead.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="unique_letters-solution.py" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.</p></li>
			</ol>
	  <h3>Problem 2 - Display Sums</h3>	
  	  <ol>
		  <li><p>Download the following code and load it into your code editor: <a href="display_sums.py" target="_blank">display_sums.py</a></p></li>
		  <li>
			<p>Your goal is to write a program that will find and display all pairs of numbers in a list that sum up to 10.  This could be done in O(n^2) with a loop within a loop.  However, using a set, this can be done in O(n) time.  You should assume that list of numbers provided has no duplicates.
			</p>
		  </li>
		<li><p>Answer this question together:  how can you solve this problem using a set data structure?  As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of a set to help you arrive at the answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you think you know how to solve the problem (take no more than five minutes), <a href="display_sums-solution.html" target="_blank">read the answer to the question</a> and compare with your initial answer.</p></li>
		<li><p>Based on your understanding, modify the unique_letters function so it uses a set instead.</p></li>
		<li><p>When you are done, take a look at the <a href="display_sums-solution.py" target="_blank">solution</a> and discuss it together.</p></li>

      <p>When finished, please complete the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
