		<p><strong>Question</strong>: How can find pairs of numbers in a list (assume no duplicates) that sum to a value of 10 and display them in O(n) time using a set data structure?</p>
        
		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If we looked at one number in the list (call it x), then we need to determine if the number 10-x is in the list.  If we looped through the list and added all the numbers to a set, we can then loop through the list again and check for 10-x.  This would result in O(n). </p>
        
        <p>We could avoid two loops.  Suppose my list was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].  If I was currently looking at the '2', then 10-2 (or 8) would not be in the set yet.  However, eventually we will get to the '8' and then '2' will be in set by that time. This is also O(n).</p>
