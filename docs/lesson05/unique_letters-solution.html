		<p><strong>Question</strong>: How can the unique letter function be written with better performance using a Set data structure?</p>
		<p><strong>Answer</strong>: A Set has the property that all items must be unique.  If the letters in the input text do not form a Set, then the function should return False.  To determine if the letters in the word form a Set, I can loop through each of the letters in the input text and add them one at a time to a Set (the Set should start out empty).  I know that I don't have unique letters if the letter I want to add to the Set is already in the Set.  I can use the membership operator "in" to determine if the letter is in the Set before I try to add it.  In the worst case, if there are no duplicates, I will have to check each letter for membership in the set and then I will have to add each member to the set.  Both of these operations are O(1) but I have to perform the "n" times.  Therefore, the performance will be O(n).</p>
