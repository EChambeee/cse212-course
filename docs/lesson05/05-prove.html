        <h1>05 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 5).  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are 2 parts to this assignment.</p>
		<h3>Part 1 - Set Operations</h3>
        <ol>
			<li><p>Download the following code file: <a href="set_operations.py" target="_blank">set_operations.py</a>  </p></li>
			<li><p>Assume you have been asked in an interview to describe how you wrould write a function to find the intersection of 2 sets and a function to find the union of 2 sets.  An intersection will return a set containing items that are common between the 2 sets.  A union will return a set containing all items from both sets.  There is an intersection (also the & operator) and union function (also the | operator) already in Python.  For this assignment, do not use these capabilities already in Python.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>In response, first write down an answer to the question as if you were giving a verbal response with an emphasis on the purposes, behavior, and/or performance of a Set.  Your response should be no more than a 30 second answer if spoken out loud.</p></li>
			<li><p>Second, implement both functions in the code file provided above.</p></li>
			<li><p>You will provide your resposne and code in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 2 - </h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Download the following code file: <a href="largest_unique_substring.py" target="_blank">largest_unique_substring.py</a> </p></li>
			<li><p>Assume you have been asked in an interview to describe how you can find the length of the longest unique substring within a text input.  For example, if the text is "ABCABCDEABABCD" it would return 5 because "ABCDE" is the longest unique substring.  Using a Set you should be able to write code that runs in O(n) time.  </p></li>
			<li><p>In response, first write down an answer to the question as if you were giving a verbal response with an emphasis on the purpose, behavior, and/or performance of a Set.  Your response should be no more than a 30 second answer if spoken out loud.</p></li>
			<li><p>Second, implement the function in the code file provided above.</p></li>
			<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>
