		<h1>01 Prepare: Problem Solving Strategies / Dynamic Arrays</h1>
				
      <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>This week you will explore Problem Solving Strategies.  To support these strategies, you will learn how to use Dynamic Arrays (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 1). </p>
		<p>This course is divided up into 3 phases: PREPARE, TEACH, and PROVE.  During the PREPARE phase, you will learn and practice different software programming skills while learning about data structures.  During the TEACH phase, you will use the skills previously learned to solve problems and teach others how to solve those problems.  In the final PROVe phase, you will demonstrate your capabilities in the final projects.  Starting this week you are in the <strong>PREPARE</strong> phase of the course:</p>

		<p>Here is the two day plan for this lesson:</p>
		<ul><p><u>Day 1</u> - Complete the reading below.  The reading should take 1 hour to complete.  For on-campus students, class time will be used to discuss the reading and explore examples.  Online students should spend an additional hour communicating with other students in Slack and reviewing any examples or information provided by your instructor.  You should begin independently to work on <a href="01-prove.html" target="_blank">01-Prove</a>.  You should plan on the assignment taking 3 hours to complete.</p></ul>
		<ul><p><u>Day 2</u> - You will work with your study group to complete <a href="01-teach.html" target="_blank">01-Teach</a>.  On-campus students will complete this activity during class time.  The activity should take 1 hour to complete.  You should independently finish work on <a href="01-prove.html" target="_blank">01-Prove</a>.</p></ul>
