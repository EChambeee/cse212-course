        <h1>01 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting all course outcomes.  You should not complete this assignment within a group.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you answer these problems.  It is an honor code violation to obtain answers for these problems from others including using the internet (i.e. sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>Download the <a href="01-prove_response.docx" target="_blank">01-prove_response.docx</a> document to provide your answers to questions asked in the steps below.</p>
	    <h3>Part 1 - List Comprehension</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="01-prove_multiples_of.py" target="_blank">01-prove_multiples_of.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>multiples_of</code> function.  The function should create and return a list of multiples of a number.  The starting number and the number of multiples are provided as inputs to the function.  For example, <code>multiples_of(3,5)</code>, where the 3 is the starting number and 5 is the number of multiples, would result in [3, 6, 9, 12, 15].  You must implement this using a single list comprehension.  You may want to write it first without a list comprehension and then modify it.</p></li>
		</ol>
	  <h3>Part 2 - Solving a Complicated Problem</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="01-prove_combine_sorted_lists.py" target="_blank">01-prove_combined_sorted_lsits.py</a></p></li>		
			<li><p>Come up with a plan on how to implement the <code>combine_sorted_lists</code> function.  This function receives two sorted lists and will return a new sorted list containing the values from both input lists.  For example, if list 1 is [1, 3, 7] and list 2 is [2, 6, 10, 11], then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11].  You cannot use the min, max, sort, or sorted Python functions to solve this problem.  Remember the suggestion to "solve the problem manually".  As you create the sorted list, how do you know that you should pick the 1 before the 2 and then pick the 2 before the 3.  Write down a process for doing step by step and then translate this to code.</p></li>
			<li><p>Remember the suggestion to "solve the problem manually".  </p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>combine_sorted_lists</code> function.  Please note that everyone will have at least one (and likely a lot more) issues while working on this problem.Â  You should keep a record while working on this problem.  </p></li>
			<li><p>In your response document, answer the following questions:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>What was your original plan to solve the problem before you implemented it?</p></li>
				<li><p>What issues did you encounter when you implemented your solution?  If you still have issues, identify your thoughts about how they might be resolved.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>In your response document, write a paragraph about the first steps you will personally use in all the problems that you will solve this semester.  You should use your experiences from the group practice and this assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>You need to submit the following files for this assignment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><code>01-prove_response.docx</code> - All answers should be provided.</p></li>
			<li><p><code>multiples_of.py</code> - Your solution from Part 1.</p></li>
			<li><p><code>combine_sorted_lists.py</code> - Your solution from Part 2.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please submit each file separately.  Do not use a compression tool (e.g., zip, rar) to combine the files.</p>
