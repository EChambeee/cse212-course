        <h1>01 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 1).  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are 3 parts to this assignment.</p>
	    <h3>Part 1 - List Comprehension</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="multiples_of.py" target="_blank">multiples_of.py</a></p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>multiples_of</code> function.  The function should create and return a list of multiples of a number.  The starting number and the number of multiples are provided as inputs to the function.  For example, multiples_of(3,5), where the 3 is the starting number and 5 is the nubmer of multiples, would result in [3, 6, 9, 12, 15].  You must implement this using a single list comprehension.  You may want to write it first without a list comprehension and then modify it.</p></li>
			<li><p>You will provide your code solution in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
	  <h3>Part 2 - Solving a Complicated Problem</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Open up the following code: <a href="combine_sorted_lists.py" target="_blank">combined_sorted_lsits.py</a></p></li>		
			<li><p>Come up with a plan on how to implement the <code>combine_sorted_lists</code> function.  This function receives two sorted lists and will return a new sorted list containing the values from both input lists.  For example, if list 1 is [1, 3, 7] and list 2 is [2, 6, 10, 11], then the resulting list would be [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11].  You cannot use the min, max, sort, or sorted python functions to solve this problem.</p></li>
			<li><p>Implement the <code>list_selector</code> function.</p></li>
			<li><p>In addition to submitting the code in the I-Learn quiz, you will also answer the following questions:</p></li>
			<ul>
				<li><p>What was your original plan to solve the problem before you implemented it?</p></li>
				<li><p>What issues did you encounter when you implemented your solution?</p></li>
				<li><p>What issues do you still need to resolve to improve your solution?  Even if your code is working, propose improvements that could still be made.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<li><p>You will provide your code solution and your responses in the I-Learn quiz.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Part 3 - Reflection</h3>
		<p>The last question in the I-Learn quiz will ask you to write a paragraph about the first steps you will personally use in all the problems that you will solve this semester.  You should use your experiences from the Group Practice and this Assignment to help formulate your response. </p>
