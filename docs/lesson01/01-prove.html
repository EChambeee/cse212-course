        <h1>01 Prove: Individual Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This assignment <strong>must be completed individually</strong> to ensure you are meeting course outcomes (ref: Syllabus Course Outcome 1).  You should not solve these problems with other students.  If you obtain help from a tutor, the tutor should help you understand principles but should not help you solve these problems.  It is an honor code violation to seek the solution to these exact problems from others including the internet (including sites that allow students to share their solutions).</p>
		<p>You will summarize all your answers in the associated I-Learn quiz.  Please note that you only get one submission attempt with the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>There are 3 parts to this assignment.</p>
		<h3>Part 1 - TBD</h3>

			<li><p>Open up the following code and determine the Big-O notation for the <code>sort_list</code> function: <a href="sorting.py" target="_blank">sorting.py</a></p></li>
		</ol>
